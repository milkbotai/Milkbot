## 🔄 Knowledge Compounding

### How Knowledge Compounds

```
Day 1: Scout searches "AI trends 2026" → 1 insight
Week 1: 5 related searches → pattern emerges
Month 1: 50 searches → expertise develops
Quarter: 200 searches → competitive advantage
```

### Learning Loop

1. **Search** → Brave API query
2. **Synthesize** → Extract insights
3. **Document** → Save to memory
4. **Apply** → Use in decisions
5. **Share** → Cross-team knowledge transfer

---

## ⚠️ Rate Limit Safeguards

### Hard Limits
- **Monthly:** 2,000 queries (free tier)
- **Warning:** 1,500 queries (80% usage)
- **Critical:** 1,800 queries (90% usage)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Cache results** - Don't re-search same topics
2. **Batch queries** - Group related searches
3. **Use alternatives** - Perplexity for deep research
4. **Manual verification** - Only API for quick facts
5. **Weekly review** - Adjust quotas as needed

### Emergency Protocol
If 90% limit reached:
1. Switch to Perplexity for deep research
2. Prioritize critical searches only
3. MilkBot approves any additional queries
4. Document overflow for next month
